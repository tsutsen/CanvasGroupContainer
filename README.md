A new node that brings `CanvasGroup` functionality to `Control` nodes.
With it, you can combine `CanvasGroup` visual effects with the layout convenience of Godotâ€™s Control system.

# Features
- **Rendering**: refer to Godot's [CanvasGroup docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_canvasgroup.html).
- **Layout**: refer to Godot's [Control docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_control.html).

# Installation 
1. Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/tsutsen/CanvasGroupContainer/releases) page.
2. Extract the archive.
3. Place addons folder into the root of your Godot project.
4. Go to `Project` -> `Project Settings` -> `Plugins` and turn on `CanvasGroupContainer` plugin.

Done! Now you can add `CanvasGroupContainer` to your scenes from the "Create New Node" menu.

# Usage
